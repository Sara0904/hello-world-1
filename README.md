# hello-world
Day 1 of GenCyber and I am trying to survive! This information is way over my head.
I have been a Marketing Teacher for 36 Years. I worked at Suffolk High School for 10 years and then it closed. I have been at Nansemond River High School for 26 years.

You are doing great!!  There are a lot of steps to finish each of the parts of the project!! Sara :)
